# VNF-graphs in Edge Vector format

Small collection of sparse VNF-graphs in [Edge Vector representation](https://github.com/rodispantelis/EdgeVector) suitable to be used as requests in embedding algorithms.
Node capacity demands are in GHz, edge bandwidth demands are in Mbps. Includes spatial constraints so that incoming requests should be hoted in Dublin, according to BtEurope topology.
