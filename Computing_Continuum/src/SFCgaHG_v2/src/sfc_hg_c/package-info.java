/** This package contains the classes of a Genetic Algorithm similar to the algorithm in the package sfc_a. 
 * It is used by the PAGA for computing the fitness of various setups that are stored in the 
 * chromosomes of the population of PAGA. 
 * The "Best_c" implements the current best solution.
 * The "Chromosome_c" implements chromosomes for the GA.
 * The "GA_c" implements the Ganetic Algorithm.
 * The "Last_c" implements the last stored mapping.
 * The"Mapping_c" implements the mapping between virtual and physical resources.
