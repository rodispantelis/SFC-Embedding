# Distributed Deep Learning for SFC-Embedding v.1

Distributed DL for efficient SFC-Embedding, includes the option of running a distributed greedy algorithm for comparison. 
Includes an advanced network simulator designed for SFC embedding simulations and experimentation; 
a collection of VNF-graphs in [Edge Vector format](https://github.com/rodispantelis/EdgeVector)

* **Network_Simulator_v1**. [The network simulator.](Network_Simulator_jar_doc)

* **EVgraphs_v1**. [Collections of VNF-graphs.](EVgraphs) 

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the repository and run the executable .jar file in the [Deep Learning directory](SFCdistributed-DL_jar_doc) 
from console (use jdk-15) without changing the file structure.
