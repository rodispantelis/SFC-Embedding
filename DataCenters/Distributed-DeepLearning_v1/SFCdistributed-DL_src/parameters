%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% simulation and network parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% lines must not start with a blank space
% Network type
type fat-tree

% Server capacity
nodecapacity 20.0

% Parameter k; different usage in different topologies; even numbers only for fat-tree topologies
k 12

% VNF life cycle duration
duration 1620

% Iterations; number of incoming request to be served during each simulation session
iterations 6000

% Path to store simulation log files; if not specified, files will be stored on working directory
%path C:\\temp\\

% Path to VNFgraph files
vnfgraphs ../EVgraphs/

% The VNFgraph files are in Edge Vector format with file names of the form "chain"+r+"EV"
% where r are consecutive integer numbers in the space [r1, r1+r2) defined in the following parameters

r1 5
r2 5

% The maximum SFC size
maxsfcsize 9

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% distributed algorithm parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%parameter to define number of nodes in the cluster; cluster size = fnodes * VNF size
fnodes 4

%agent modes: 1 greedy;2 train and run network;
%3 train a new Neural Network for each request; 4 run only stored models
mode 2
