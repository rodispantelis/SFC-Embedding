# SFC-Embedding in Data Centers

Algorithms and simulation tools for Service Function Chain Embedding in Data Centers. version 1-08.2023.

* **Distributed Machine Learning**. [A Distribute Deep Learning algorithm for SFC-Embedding.](Distributed-DeepLearning_v1) [1]

* **Genetic Algorithm**. [A MultiThreaded Genetic Algorithm for SFC-Embedding.](Genetic_Algorithm_v1) [2]

[Mored details.](https://rodispantelis.github.io/SFC-Embedding/DataCenters)

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the jar files from console (use jdk-15) without changing the file structure.
