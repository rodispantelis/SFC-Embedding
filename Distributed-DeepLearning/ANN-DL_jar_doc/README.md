# Artificial Neural Network

The library is an object oriented implementation of an Artificial Neural Network.
It is trained by a Genetic Algorithm and is suitable for Unsupervised Learning projects.
It is designed for the SFC-E distributed Deep Learning algorithm. 
Its operation is determined by two editable files.

* **nnprofile**. The NN architecture and parameters of operation. Defines the type of the network; the number and size of its layers; the activation functions;bias and edge weight domain
* **gasettings**. Parameters of running the training Genetic Algorithm.
