# Distributed Deep Learning for SFC-Embedding

Distributed DL for efficient SFC-Embedding, includes the option of running a distributed greedy algorithm for comparison. 
Includes an advanced network simulator designed for SFC embedding simulations and experimentation; 
a collection of VNF-graphs in [Edge Vector format](https://github.com/rodispantelis/EdgeVector)

* **EVgraphs**. [Collections of VNF-graphs.](https://github.com/rodispantelis/SFC-Embedding/tree/main/Genetic_Algorithm/EVgraphs) 

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the jar files from console (use jdk-15) without changing the file structure.
