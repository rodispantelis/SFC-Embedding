# VNF-graphs in Edge Vector format

Small collection of dense VNF-graphs (average node degree â‰ˆ 3.51) in [Edge Vector representation](https://github.com/rodispantelis/EdgeVector) suitable to be used as requests in embedding algorithms.
Node capacity demands are in GHz, edge bandwidth demands are in Mbps.
