* **Genetic Algorithm**. [A MultiThreaded Genetic Algorithm for SFC-Embedding.](https://github.com/rodispantelis/SFC-Embedding/tree/main/Genetic_Algorithm/)

A simple way to test these algorithms is to download the whole repository and run the jar files from console (use jdk-15) without changing the file structure.
