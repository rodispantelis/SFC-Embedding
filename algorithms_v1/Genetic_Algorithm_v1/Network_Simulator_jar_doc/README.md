# Network Simulator v.1

It is an advanced network simulator designed for SFC embedding simulations and experimentation.
Currently it supports 3-tier fat-tree topologies that are comonly used in modern datacenters.
The simulator is written in Java 8 and it is only necessary to add the project
or the .jar file in the classpath of any project that uses it; like in the algorithms presented here.

* **Network_Simulator.jar**. The library in .jar archive.
